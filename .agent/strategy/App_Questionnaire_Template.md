# App Questionnaire Template

**Goal:** This document serves as the high-level, human-readable input that a Voice Assistant or Business Analyst fills out. An Agentic AI (like Antigravity) will read this file and translate the answers into technical `moqui-ai` blueprints (Entities, Screens, Services).
